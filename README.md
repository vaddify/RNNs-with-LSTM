# RNNs-with-LSTM
Predict Stock Price S&amp;P500
**Objective**

Let us design and implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Python that can forecast stock prices using S&P500 dataset. 

In this scenario the model will learn from historical stock price data and forecast future stock prices.

**Dataset**
- We will use the S&P 500 stock data dataset, which contains historical stock price data for the S&P 500 companies.

**Detailed Steps:**
- Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for input to the RNN model. We will consider factors like feature selection, normalization, and scaling to ensure the best results from the RNN model.
- Design and implement an RNN model using Python's with PyTorch.
- We will use the RNN model with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cells to dela with the vanishing gradient problem and retain information over time.
- We will define suitable loss function and optimizer to train the RNN model  on the preprocessed stock price dataset 
- We will use RNN model to forecast future stock prices, given a starting stock price input and plot them both.
- Finally, we will evaluate the model performance.
